In this portfolio, I've incorporated several design concepts to create a visually appealing and functional website.
<br>I have deployed website using Github pages  <a href="https://syedfahad11.github.io/Portfolio-CSS/">My Portfolio </a>


### Brief Overview of my work - 
1. **CSS Styling**: I've utilized CSS to style the webpage elements, including fonts, colors, margins, and alignments, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing layout.

2. **Responsive Design**: With the use of percentage-based widths and max-width properties for images, the portfolio adapts well to different screen sizes, maintaining readability and visual appeal across devices.

3. **Typography**: By combining different font families such as Merriweather, Sacramento, and Montserrat, I've achieved a balanced typographic hierarchy, enhancing the readability and visual appeal of headings and text.

4. **Image Placement**: Images are strategically placed within the layout using floats and margins to create an engaging visual experience while maintaining readability and balance.

5. **Background Design**: The use of background colors and images, including clouds positioned with absolute positioning, adds depth and visual interest to the webpage.

6. **Button Styling**: Buttons are styled with rounded corners, contrasting colors, and hover effects to encourage interaction and provide clear calls to action.

7. **Footer Design**: The footer incorporates links styled as buttons for easy navigation, while the overall design complements the color scheme of the page.

8. **Accessibility**: Colors and fonts are chosen with accessibility in mind, ensuring that text remains readable and distinguishable for all users.

By integrating these design concepts, I've created a portfolio that not only showcases content effectively but also provides an enjoyable and accessible user experience.
